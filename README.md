## Usage
1. Adjust the timezones and city to the ones that are relevant to you. It's fairly easy to modify the template to suit your needs.
2. Use the template by executing it within a note. That should work by utlizing a shortcut or a [custom-made button](https://github.com/shabegom/buttons) as shown in the example.
