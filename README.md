# obsidian-meeting-time-finder
[Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) template for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that heavily utilized Javascript for finding suitable meeting times between three (or more) locations set in different time zones.

## Motivation
Working a lot in international teams, it's always a pain to find suitable times for online meetings. This becomes especially annoying when it has to be checked the timezone has already moved in or out of [daylight saving time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time_by_country#Observance_as_of_2022).

## Showcase (using the [buttons](https://github.com/shabegom/buttons) plugin to generate the table)

## Usage
1. Adjust the timezones and city to the ones that are relevant to you. It's fairly easy to modify the template to suit your needs
2. Use the template by executing it within a note. That should work by utlizing a shortcut or a [custom-made button](https://github.com/shabegom/buttons) as shown in the example
3. If you like to renew the table, you need to reload the template
